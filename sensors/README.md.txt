This sensors file incorporates instantiation of the accelerometer in +- 4G, the gyroscope using 250 degrees/second for maximum sensitivity, and the magnetometer using microTeslas.

It serial prints readings of each sensor to the console as a test, and alerts the user if any of the sensors do not connect successfully.
